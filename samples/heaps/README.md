# Calligro Heaps.io Sample

This project is configured to compile to HashLink so it's required to run it.
Of course, you can easily reconfigure it to compile to JavaScript.

Compile and run:

```bash
haxe compile.hxml
hl out/calligro-sample.hl
```

See the [CalligroSample](src/CalligroSample.hx) class for the actual font usage.
