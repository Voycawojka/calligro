# Bitmap Font Usage Samples

## Important

Note there are multiple versions of the BMFont format. 
Currently Calligro can only produce the TXT one and therefore may not be compatible with some tools.

Known technologies that support bitmap fonts but aren't compatible with Calligro:
- Phaser (supports XML version only)
