# Bitmap Font Usage Samples

Those sample projects contain no Calligro specific code.
They only demonstrate how to use the BMFont format with different technologies and serve as a prove that Calligro follows the specification correctly.

## Important

Note there are multiple versions of the BMFont format. 
Currently Calligro can only produce the TXT one and therefore may not be compatible with some tools.

Known technologies that support bitmap fonts but aren't compatible with Calligro:
- Phaser (supports XML version only)
